    This is very much a WIP project, but the idea is that it will allow you to create and embed one (or more) guestbooks
    into your site!
</p>
<p>
    The platform mostly works and should be fairly stable. So even though it's missing some polish you can already <a
        href="/admin/signin">Sign in</a>, create a guestbook, and share it with others!
</p>
<p>
    You'd be doing me a favor if you
    decide to give this a try and <a href="https://codeberg.org/meadowingc/guestbooks/issues">report any issues</a> you
    find ðŸ˜Š
</p>

<p>
    This service free. I don't plan on adding any paid plan in the forseeable future.
