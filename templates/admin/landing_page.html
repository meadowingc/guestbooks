        ðŸ“¢ Stay up to date with new changes and updates by following our official Fediverse account: <a

<p>
    This is very much a WIP project, but the idea is that it will allow you to create and embed one (or more) guestbooks
    into your site!
</p>
<p>
    The platform mostly works and should be fairly stable. Even though it's missing some polish, you can already <a
        href="/admin/signin">sign in</a>, create a guestbook, and share it with others!
</p>
<p>
    If you decide to give this a try, I'd really appreciate it if you could <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/meadowingc/guestbooks/issues">report any issues</a> you find. ðŸ˜Š
</p>

<p>
    Note that this platform is very much a development project. I created it because I wanted a guestbook on my blog and
    thought it would be fun. However, it may be unreliable and prone to breaking from time to time. I'll do my best to
    keep it working, but if you need something more <i>serious</i>, you might want to consider some of the other great
    guestbook services out there.
</p>
<p>
    This service is free. I don't plan on introducing any paid plans in the foreseeable future, and if I do, all current
    users will remain free forever (or at least as long as the platform exists).
</p>
<p>
    If you find <i>Guestbooks</i> useful and want to support its ongoing development (and perhaps fuel my caffeine
    addiction), you can buy me a coffee via my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/meadowingc" target="_blank">Ko-fi page</a>.
    Your support helps make <i>Guestbooks</i> self-sustaining and encourages me to continue working on it. Thanks so much
    for your kindness! ðŸ¤—

<h2>Suggested Alternatives</h2>
<div>
    If for some reason you don't like <i>Guestbooks</i>, here are some indie-web-friendly alternatives you can consider:
</div>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://atabook.org/" target="_blank">Atabook</a> - it's not open source, but otherwise seems to be well supported and free (as of <code>2025-08-01</code>).</li>
</ul>
